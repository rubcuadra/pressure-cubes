<h1>Pressure Cubes!</h1>
<p>Small videogame built with React & Redux to show my npm module React-Pressure. <a href="https://rubcuadra.github.io/pressure-cubes/">Try it now!</a></p> 
<p>The game works better with 3D touch enabled iOS devices, however, the module allows to fake the 3D touch on some Android devices, while some others might experience bugs or laggy scenes</p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The objective is to achieve the highest score by avoiding collisions with the moving objects, every 30 seconds the game turns harder by spawning more objects or applying transformations. You have 5 lifes and each collision reduces your life by 1</p>
